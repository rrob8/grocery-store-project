Hello, and welcome to my project , the Grocery store
This page is comprised of html, css, javscript, and a db.json file 
i use to store the items. 
All the products that are available are already fetched from the database
and made as buttons with their name and price visible.

Here you wil see there are a few key features:

1) Clicking on one of the green item buttons will add it to the shopping cart.

2) The cart price total is automatically updated once an item is added.

3) Clicking the clear button will remove all items from the cart and reset the total to $0

4) Previewing the item picture is as easy as mousing over the button and the picture of the current 
item appears

5) To request a new item, enter a product name in text as well as as an image link and click "Request Item".
The new item name will appear in grocery store list along with a randomly assigned price and the picture you provided.
(Notice) There is no protection provided against malicious code entered into these fields.

REMINDER: execute this code in your terminal to begin: "json-server --watch db.json --port 3000"
